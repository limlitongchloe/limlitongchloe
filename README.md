<h3>My reflections for Interactive Development.</h3>
<h5>Week 2:</h5>
<p>I have learnt how to use tags like <header>, <footer>,<article>,<section>,<nav>, <p>, and heading tags like <h1>,<h2> and all the way to <h6>. These tags are used for us to distinguish the information from others.</p>
<p>We have also learnt how to give style to our headers, paragraphs, and information in the page using css. There are ways like inline style where only one style is used in a line(<p style='" ">information</p>) and style element where we use <style> to include and use more styles. </p>
<p>These styles are used to give color to background(background-color) or to the text(color) or even change the text into a different font(font-family).</p>
<p>However, I have also learnt that in order to give style to our information in css, I have to connect the html file together with the css file, using <link> element under <head> in html.</p>
<p>As for the details of the color we can give to the information in the page, we can use hexadecimal mode, for example, #000000 or RGB(set red, green, blue portions of the color) or RGBA(different from RGB, with a letter A at the back, it changes gradient).</p>
<p>For fonts, we can use google fonts to get different types of fonts.</p>
<p>There is another faster way to give styles to information if you want to apply the same styles to parts of the information. We can use class, .(classname) , and ID attributes, #(ID name) under <style> element.</p>
